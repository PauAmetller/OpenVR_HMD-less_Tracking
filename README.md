# OpenVR HMD-less Tracking Library

This repository contains an openVR Tracking library that uses the HTC Vive Base Stations and Trackers for 3D tracking without the need of the HMD or the controllers at any point.

There is also a base Unity project that uses the tracking library to perform a calibration process and obtain a calibration file, which can then be applied in your own projects. A ready-to-use template based on this calibration is available here: [Interactive Systems Updated Template](https://github.com/PauAmetller/InteractiveSystemsUpdatedTemplate/tree/main).

Inside the Guides folder, youâ€™ll find all the necessary information to integrate and adapt your own project in order to use the obtained calibration. The system offers great adaptability and can be used in most environments, with the main requirement being that the projection area must have a four-sided, straight-edged layout with right angles (e.g., a rectangular or square shape).

This library was developed as a UPF Bachelor's Final Project for FubIntLab and its interactive interaction Mixed Meality space and is now being released as an open source project "as is". The project was later further improved by another UPF Bachelor's student as part of his Final Project.

## Unity Tracking Base Project

This Unity project implements all the necessary functionality to perform a calibration using the tracking system. The resulting calibration can then be used in your own projects adapted to use the calibration generated by the Unity Tracking Base Project.
Note: The calibration must be performed in the same physical environment setup in which it will be used, as it is specific to that spatial configuration.
